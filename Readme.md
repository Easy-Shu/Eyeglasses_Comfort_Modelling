# Eyeglasses Comfort Modelling
## Facial Landmarks for Eyeglasses Attachment Points
For eyeglasses frames, there are two components contacting the facial surface: (1) the nose pads which contact the nasal bridge, and (2) the temples which contact the temporal area at the upper attachment of the external ear and the mastoid area at the back of the ears. Hence, there are two main eyeglasses attachment points on facial surface: nose attachment points (NAPs), and ear attachment ponts (EAPs). Both of them are different from the previous verified landmarks (e.g., Tragion, Glabella, and Maxilofrontale). Hence, we provide a parameterized 3D facial mesh template ("Template_Face.ply") with NAPs/EAPs ("Template_Landmarks.csv") for references.
